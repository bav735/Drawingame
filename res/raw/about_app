Drawingame is an app that implements interactive drawing. It allows multiple users to unite to draw collective pictures. An image is drawn on a device screen by finger. A drawing can be saved to memory or shared through social networks.

After the app starts, you will see the initial dialog, which has two fields:
1) Nickname
It's the alias the other users will associate you with.
2) Room name
Users are divided to rooms. All users of a particular room draw conjoint picture. It means that you will draw together with all the users that have selected the same room as you. If you want to play with friends, arrange in advance which room name you will use.

After processing the input, the room's actual drawing will be received automatically. It's time to start drawing. Click on the icon at the right upper corner of the screen to open menu. Some options are needed to be explained:
1) Commit drawing
The changes made by you will be fixed on the joint image. The drawing of each user inside the room will be updated. Committed changes can't be undone (but they can be erased:).
2) Save drawing
This option saves the drawing on the screen to internal memory of your device. It will be opened in the gallery then.
3) Post drawing to Twitter
You will be redirected to Twitter authentication dialog. Pass your credentials and the image will be posted to your wall.
